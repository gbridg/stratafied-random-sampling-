# stratafied-random-sampling-
Stratified sampling when your strata are not evenly divisible by the number of treatment groups you have can introduce non-random bias. This Stata do-file randomly assigns the population to 5 treatment groups across the stratified sample, and assigns the leftover individuals (because the number of strata is not divisible by 5) to one of the treatments, randomly.
